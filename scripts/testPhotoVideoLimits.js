🧪 Photo/Video Limits Implementation Test Plan

✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Database Migration: user_photo_usage table with atomic RPC functions
2. Tracking IDs: Bulletproof stable identifiers that survive reinstalls
3. Photo Usage Service: TanStack Query + Zustand for smooth UX
4. Video Service: Updated to block free users completely
5. UI Integration: UsageLimitBanner shows usage with paywall trigger
6. Settings Screen: Displays photo/video usage with refresh
7. Restoration Flow: Atomic pre-increment + rollback on failure

🔄 MANUAL TESTING SCENARIOS:

📸 Photo Limits (Free Users):
- Install app → Should show 0/5 photos used
- Restore 3 photos → Should show 3/5 photos used  
- Try 6th photo → Should show paywall
- Upgrade to Pro → Should show unlimited photos

🎬 Video Limits (Pro Users Only):
- Free user tries video → Should be blocked with paywall
- Pro user gets videos → Should show usage count (e.g., 5/31)
- Usage persists across app sessions

🔄 Bulletproof Reinstall Test:
- Use 3 photos → Delete app → Reinstall → Should still show 3/5 used
- Same for Pro video usage tracking

⚙️ Settings Screen:
- Shows photo usage: "3/5" for free, "∞" for Pro
- Shows video usage: Only for Pro users
- Tap to refresh functionality works

🚀 Performance:
- TanStack Query provides caching and background updates
- Optimistic updates for smooth UX
- Automatic retries on failure

💾 Database Validation:
- user_photo_usage table tracks free users
- user_video_usage table tracks Pro users  
- Atomic RPC functions prevent race conditions
- Stable tracking IDs prevent reinstall abuse

✅ ALL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR TESTING
