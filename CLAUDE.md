## Project: Photo Restoration HD Mobile App

### Overview
A React Native (Expo) mobile app for AI-powered photo restoration using Replicate's restore-image model. Photos are stored locally on device with metadata synced to Supabase.

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **AI Model**: flux-kontext-apps/restore-image (Replicate API)
- **Storage**: Local device storage via expo-file-system
- **Backend**: Supabase (authentication & metadata only)
- **State Management**: React Context + React Query

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. **No Cloud Photo Storage**: All photos remain on user's device for privacy
2. **Polling-First Approach**: 5-7 second processing time makes polling optimal
3. **Webhook-Ready**: Infrastructure supports webhooks for future scaling
4. **Offline-First**: Core functionality works without constant internet

### API Configuration
```javascript
// Replicate Model
model: "flux-kontext-apps/restore-image"
API Reference: https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/restore-image/api/api-reference

// Environment Variables
EXPO_PUBLIC_REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_[token]
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### API Token Setup
1. **Replicate API Token**: Must use `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side access
2. **Token Validation**: Service includes automatic token validation and logging
3. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for authentication failures
4. **Rate Limiting**: Handles rate limits with appropriate user feedback

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Polling-based restoration with local storage
2. **Phase 2 (Scale)**: Add webhooks, queue management, push notifications

### Project Structure
```
app/               # Expo Router screens
components/        # Reusable UI components  
services/          # API integrations (Replicate, Supabase, Storage)
contexts/          # React contexts for state
hooks/             # Custom React hooks
types/             # TypeScript definitions
```

### Key Features
- Camera/Gallery photo selection
- Real-time processing status
- Before/After comparison slider
- Local gallery of restored photos
- User authentication & preferences
- Export to camera roll

### Development Guidelines
1. Always resize images before processing (max 2048px)
2. Use expo-file-system for all local storage operations
3. Handle network errors gracefully with retry logic
4. Keep UI responsive during 5-7 second processing time
5. Test on both iOS and Android devices
6. **Use NativeWind/Tailwind classes for all styling** - StyleSheet has been completely replaced

### Styling System
- **Framework**: NativeWind v4 with Tailwind CSS
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic support with `dark:` prefixes
- **Colors**: Blue (#3B82F6), Purple (#8B5CF6), Green (#16A34A), Amber (#F59E0B)
- **Spacing**: Consistent Tailwind spacing scale (p-5, mb-4, gap-5)
- **Typography**: Standardized text sizes and weights
- **Components**: All major components updated to use NativeWind

### Completed NativeWind Migration
âœ… PhotoPicker component - Modern gradient buttons with animations
âœ… HomeScreen - Clean background with dark mode support
âœ… RestorationScreen - Card-based layout with action buttons
âœ… GalleryScreen - Grid layout with professional interface
âœ… ThemedText - Tailwind typography utilities
âœ… ThemedView - Background classes with dark mode
âœ… Collapsible - Modern expandable cards
âœ… HelloWave - Updated with Tailwind classes
âœ… NotFoundScreen - Improved error page design

### Testing Commands
```bash
npm start          # Start Expo development
npm run ios        # Run on iOS simulator
npm run android    # Run on Android emulator
npm run lint       # Check code quality (âœ… All issues resolved)
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### iOS Build Issues

#### Associated Domains Capability Error
**Problem**: `expo run:ios` works once, then fails with "Provisioning profile doesn't support the Associated Domains capability"

**Root Cause**: 
- Empty `associatedDomains: []` in app.json enables the capability in iOS project files
- Removing it from app.json doesn't remove it from generated native files
- Your provisioning profile doesn't have this capability enabled

**Solution**:
1. Remove `associatedDomains: []` from app.json
2. Regenerate iOS project: `npx expo prebuild --clean --platform ios`
3. Run again: `npx expo run:ios`

**Prevention**:
- Don't add capabilities you don't need
- After removing capabilities from app.json, always run `prebuild --clean`
- For local dev, `expo run:ios` is usually sufficient
- For production, use EAS Build which handles provisioning automatically

#### Switching iOS Simulators
```bash
# List available simulators
xcrun simctl list devices | grep -E "iPhone|iPad"

# Run on specific device
npx expo run:ios --device "iPad Pro 13-inch (M4)"
```

## Performance Optimization Tasks

### High Priority (Battery & Performance)

#### ðŸ”‹ Battery Drain - Infinite Animation Controls
- [ ] **Add AppState listeners to infinite animations**:
  - components/BottomCameraButton.tsx:24-34 (glow animation)
  - app/index.tsx:142-152 (capture button glow) 
  - app/index.tsx:154-170 (PRO button rotation)
  - components/CircularProgress.tsx:57-85 (4 simultaneous animations)
- [ ] **Create useBackgroundAwareAnimation hook** for centralized control
- [ ] **Integrate polling cancellation with AppState** (services/replicate.ts)
- **Impact**: 30-50% reduction in battery usage

#### ðŸŽ¯ React Optimization - Missing Memoization
- [ ] **Add React.memo to heavy components**:
  - components/BeforeAfterSlider.tsx
  - components/ProcessingScreen.tsx
  - components/PhotoPicker.tsx
- [ ] **Add useMemo/useCallback for expensive operations**:
  - app/gallery-modal.tsx (renderItem, renderSectionHeader, grouping logic)
  - app/restoration/[id].tsx (missing callback optimizations)
- **Impact**: Smoother UI interactions and reduced jank

### Medium Priority (UI Performance)

#### ðŸ“± FlatList Performance
- [ ] **Add missing FlatList optimizations** to gallery modal:
  - getItemLayout for fixed-size items
  - maxToRenderPerBatch and windowSize  
  - removeClippedSubviews
  - initialNumToRender
- [ ] **Add performance props** to restoration screen horizontal list
- **Impact**: Smoother scrolling in large galleries

#### ðŸš€ App Launch Optimization
- [ ] **Compress large image assets**:
  - assets/images/icon.png (1.69MB â†’ ~100KB)
  - assets/images/splash-icon.png (1.26MB â†’ ~50KB)
- [ ] **Consider WebP format** for better compression
- **Impact**: Faster app download and launch times

### Low Priority (Code Quality)

#### ðŸ§¹ Bundle Size Review
- [ ] **Audit package.json dependencies** for unused packages
- [ ] **Check for unused imports** across components
- [ ] **Consider lazy loading** for heavy dependencies
- **Impact**: Smaller app download size

### âœ… Already Well Implemented (No Action Needed)

The following optimizations are already properly implemented in the codebase:
- **Cleanup functions in useEffect hooks** - Comprehensive cleanup across all components
- **AppState management** - Proper listeners for camera and network management  
- **Timer/interval cleanup** - All timeouts and intervals are properly cleaned up
- **Animation infrastructure** - Solid foundation with Reanimated
- **FlatList basics** - keyExtractor and basic optimization already in place
- **Image resizing** - Already handled with proper loading screens during restoration

### Implementation Notes
- **Test on both iOS and Android** after each optimization
- **Use React DevTools Profiler** to measure re-render improvements
- **Monitor memory usage** with Flipper or similar tools
- **Measure battery impact** using Xcode Instruments or Android Studio Profiler
- **Keep performance metrics** before and after optimizations
